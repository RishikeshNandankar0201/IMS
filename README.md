# IMS
Inventory Management System


I have created a dictionary named "ims_record" under which provided 30 items, 5 values each and added keys to them.

Nextly I have tried to take a key value of an item.

Nextly I have changed the key value of given position and printed it.

I asked user for some values and calculated the total quantity and displayed it/

Created a json file and converted the given data. Then used dumps and loads function to convert data.

I have opend a new text file named "ims_record.txt" and stored data into it using read and write function.
